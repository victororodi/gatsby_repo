One way to help your customers get the answers they need to complete the sale is to assemble a list of Frequently Asked Questions (usually referred to as FAQs or FAQ pages), with clear, simple answers to each. It can help cut down the number of calls made by users hence saves time and eliminates customer frustration.

The approach we used to help this client will help you develop an effective set of Frequently Asked Questions.

**Step 1. Develop the List of Questions**

Customers won't order until they have sufficient information about both the product and the business. To ensure that your site delivers complete product and business information, you need to develop a Product/Service and Business Information Set. Simply put, it is the full set of questions that a customer might have about your product or service and your business.
Start by brainstorming a comprehensive list of the customer questions as possible. Next, survey the questions that have come in via e-mail, phone, live chat inquiries, etc.

**Step 2. Write Answers to Each Question, Then Test**

Next, write responses to each question and donâ€™t forget to ask the customer if he/she was happy with the answers and if not ask your customer to suggest better answers. Note any follow up questions and revise your scripts accordingly.

**Step 3. Organize the FAQ Page**

Now it's time to organize your Frequently Asked Questions. With a small list, the order of questions might be based on how frequently they are asked.
But with a longer list of 20 or more, FAQs are often categorized by topics, such as: Tech Support, General Product Info, Policies, etc. Don't hesitate to put a question in more than one category if appropriate.
For long list it is important to use accordion i.e. the hidden answer so that when you click on the hyperlink, the answer appears immediately below the question. This allows you to keep the other questions in view unless your answer runs to more than a couple of paragraphs.

**Step 4. Point People to Your FAQ**

Step 4 is to design your Webpages to point clearly to your FAQ section to cut down call center costs. You can suggest to your customers that they may find answers on the FAQ.

**Step 5. Monitor, Test, and Revise Your FAQ**

The final step is to monitor, continually test, and make called-for revisions to your FAQ pages.
