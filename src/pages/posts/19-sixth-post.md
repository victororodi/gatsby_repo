A landing page is simply a web page that appears when a potential customer clicks on an advertisement or search engine result link. It provides an immediate call-to-action (CTA) for the generated keywords being targeted by good links and quality contents. Landing pages have grown to become a fundamental aspect of Pay-Per-Click (PPC) ad management to generate leads. For you to succeed as a digital marketing expert, you need to monitor closely landing pages, testing regularly, uniquely optimize them for search engines and integrating their leads, conversions and gathered information.

An excellent first step is to make your pages more persuasive. You can provide great information, but unless your copy is persuasive, people won't buy. Attracting traffic to your website is just half the work, getting them to complete transaction is the other half which is not easy to do. It is vital to set up accurate targeting and efficient communications.

Landing pages play an important role in converting web traffic to customers, getting them to click on the submit button, with accurate testing and management it can generate great results. As a digital marketer, you need to pay attention to landing pages the same way you give to keywords and social media.

**Main Aims of a Landing Page:**

-To get visitors to purchase a product or service
<br /> 
-To get visitors to subscribe
<br />
-To get visitors to learn something new
<br />
-To get visitors to tell a friend

**Things you need to take into consideration:**

**Call to Action**

Include a call to action (CTA) e.g. learn, buy, visit, subscribe etc.

**Button**

Make the call to action look like a button and make it larger with bright colors.

**Emphasize Benefits**

Focus on benefits not features; emotions are what really motivate us to purchase something. We like to have the logic to justify our purchase logically, but the actual reason most of us buy a particular item because it fulfills an emotional need. Don't tell me the only the specs or facts about a product; tell me how my life will be improved if I buy it.

**Lack of Clutter**

Avoid unnecessary noise and clutter on the page. Too many bright graphics and excessive bold text can distract visitors. Links to other offers may confuse customers from their purchase mission. When presented with too many options, visitors can get confused and leave a site. Or if they get distracted, visitors might totally forget why they entered your site in the first place. Retain focus.

**Continuity**

There must be continuity between the ad and the landing page. Inconsistent messages will confuse your visitor. If she clicks on an ad with a certain value proposition, then the landing page should reinforce the appeal mentioned in the ad copy. If a user clicks on an ad for an "iPhone 9s" don't take her to a Samsung Galaxy Smartphone page; take him/her directly to what he/she is looking for.

**Contact Check**

Ensure that your customer can contact you easily; any unanswered email or call can mean a loss to a product or service purchase.

**Trust Enhancers**

A professional looking website also conveys confidence to the visitor that your site is trustworthy. Provide trust factors on your landing page whenever possible which can include testimonials.

**SSL Certificates**

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates are used by e-commerce sites to encrypt sensitive information during online transactions. If your customers see an expired SSL notice, they'll leave quickly, so keep your SSL certificates up to date. Most visitors don't know what the notice means and will leave your page feeling very uncomfortable about doing business with you.

**Browser Compatibility**

Test your landing page in different browsers i.e. Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Donâ€™t be in a rush to build landing pages without the extensive testing. BrowserShots.org is a free tool that lets you see how pages render on different browsers.
Testing pages under different browsers takes time, but landing pages that render poorly make a bad impression and can cost you sales.
