>Keywords
 When people go online to find something, most will begin at a search engine like Google, they enter a keyword or phrase that describes what they are looking for and then scan through the results page to find a site they consider relevant. Everything search engines do to return relevant search results is built around keywords, it’s no wonder almost everything in SEO is based around keywords.

 #### Choosing the Right Keywords for your website or blog
 **Internal Brainstorming**

 No one knows your site, products or services better than you do. Think about what your clients are looking for and how they would use the search engines to find your business. Try to focus on keywords and phrases your clients would actually use when talking about your business, products and services or words used when they have asked questions in the past.

 **External Brainstorming**

 Ask friends and family to do search in order to find the products or services you sell. What terms and phrases do they use? Others can see and describe your products in a very different manner when they aren’t current clients or familiar with the products you sell or provide.

 **Feedback from Clients**

 Ask clients what impressions they get of your site, business, products and services and write down the words they use. These phrases and ideas come from those who have already found your business and purchased in the past.

 **Discussions and Forums**

 Almost every industry has some form of discussion group or forum, where people can discuss problems or seek advice. Using these groups and forums is a great place to find keywords that people use when casually referring to the product and services.

 **Keyword Tools**

 Tools like Google keyword planner and other keyword discovery tools are great ways to find new keywords to use specifically targeting your market.
